# Logistic Regression
#### Logistic regression is mainly used to estimate probablility that an instance belongs to a particular class. If estimated probablity is greater than the set threshold then it is labeled as 1 else 0.
#### It is mainly used for binary classification. Logistic also known as logit is a sigmoid function that returns value from 0 to 1.
#### Pair is called corcordant if the probability of 1 if 1 is more than probablility of 1 if 0.
#### This file contains information of logistic regression, its implementation, validation, tests.
